    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently working at Copenhagen University in the GPCR Computational 
      Drug Design Group of David Gloriam. I have the responsibility of the 
      maintenance and development of GPCRdb.org.

      My skills are primarily acquired from two distinct backgrounds; 
      An academic background and my experience as a Linguistic Officer (Sprogofficer) 
      in the Danish Military with a deployment to Helmand, Afghanistan. 
      From the military experience I have skills within communication 
      and project management while my analytical skills are grounded 
      in my academic background - a strong combination in innovative environments.

          Bioinformatics is an active, interdisciplinary field of research. 
          Over the past five decades, biological research has revolutionised our 
          understanding of life's molecular basis. Research has evolved from the 1940's 
          discovery that genetic information is coded within DNA, until today, 
          when the completed DNA sequences for a number of species – 
          including humans – are known.

          These, as well as other important discoveries, have changed the biological sciences. 
          Not too long ago, genes were studied one at a time. Now, experimental technologies 
          allow us the chance to investigate all of an organism's genes, as well as their 
          levels of activity and complex interactions.

          Bioinformatics is indispensable in the management and analysis of increasingly 
          vast quantities of data generated by these experiments. The field aims 
          to tackle biological hurdles using mathematical and statistical computational 
          methods. Modern biological and medical research are virtually impossible 
          without bioinformatics.
